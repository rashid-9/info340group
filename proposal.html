      <h1>Problem/Data Domain</h1>
      <p>
        Many people want to track what they to lose weight, build muscle, or
        stay healthy, but tracking calories and macros can be confusing without
        help. Nutrition tracking is also a data challenge due to people needing
        acurate food information and a way to link it to their body and goals.
        Apps like MyFintenessPal show that tracking can help people understand
        their eating habits, but there apps can feel overwhelming, filled with
        ads, or locked behind subcriptions. The main challenge is turning data
        inputted into simple and personal targets. While reliable public
        nutrition data sources exist, using them in a simple web application
        requires accuracy and intuitive interface.

      <h1>App Description</h1>

      <p>
        Our proposed web app is a calorie and nutrient tracker made for students
        and beginners who want something simpler and easier to use than large
        commercial nutrition apps. Users create a profile by entering basic
        information like age, height, weight, and activity level, then choose a
        fitness goal such as losing weight, maintaining weight, or gaining
        muscle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Based on this information, the app calculates a daily calorie goal and
        macronutrient targets using common nutrition formulas and shows them in
        a clear daily “budget” view. This app is meant to help users stay
        organized and understand their nutrition without needing a lot of prior
        knowledge.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Features</h2>

      <h3>Feature 1 (significant): Goal and target calculator</h3>
      <p>
        The app includes a guided setup form that calculates personalized daily
        calorie and macronutrient targets. Users can also adjust preferences,
        such as choosing to focus on higher protein intake.
      </p>

      <h3>Feature 2 (significant): Food logging with automatic totals</h3>
      <p>
        Users can log foods they eat and choose serving sizes, and the app will
        automatically update daily totals for calories, protein, carbohydrates,
        and fat. Nutrition data will come from a small curated dataset based on
        a reliable source like USDA FoodData Central instead of unverified user
        entries.
      </p>

      <h3>Feature 2.5 (half feature): Progress dashboard</h3>
      <p>
        The app shows simple weekly summaries, including average calories and
        macros, commonly logged foods, and consistency streaks. This helps users
        notice patterns in their eating habits rather than only focusing on
        daily numbers.
      </p>

      <h1>Users and Impacts</h1>
      <p>
        The app is designed to be inclusive and avoid judgmental language.
        Gender input is optional, and users can add custom foods if the dataset
        does not match what they eat. This is important because many food
        databases and health apps do not represent culturally diverse diets,
        which can make these tools less useful for some users.
