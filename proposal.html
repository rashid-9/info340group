            Many people want to track what they to lose weight, build muscle, or stay healthy, but tracking calories and macros can be confusing without help. Nutrition tracking is also a data challenge due to people needing acurate food information and a way to link it to their body and goals. Apps like MyFintenessPal show that tracking can help people understand their eating habits, but there apps can feel overwhelming, filled with ads, or locked behind subcriptions.

            The main challenge is turning data inputted into simple and personal targets. While reliable public nutrition data sources exist, using them in a simple web application requires accuracy and intuitive interface.
